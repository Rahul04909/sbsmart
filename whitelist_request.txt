Subject: Request to Whitelist Legitimate Contact Form Script

Dear Support Team,

I am experiencing frequent "406 Not Acceptable" errors triggered by ModSecurity on my contact form submission script.

This is a legitimate "Contact Us" feature for my business website (sbsmart.in). The script collects standard user inquiries (Name, Email, Phone, Message) and sends an email via SMTP.

I have already:
1. Renamed form fields to avoid generic names (e.g., used 'user_name' instead of 'name').
2. Implemented strict input sanitization (htmlspecialchars, filter_var).
3. Removed all regex patterns from the PHP code to avoid false positives.
4. Ensured no executable commands are present.

Despite these measures, legitimate submissions are being blocked.

Affected URL: https://sbsmart.in/contact-submit.php
Method: POST

Could you please examine the ModSecurity logs for my account and whitelist the rule ID that is being triggered by this specific script?

I can confirm that the file `contact-submit.php` is safe and contains only standard PHPMailer and PDO database insertion logic.

Thank you,
